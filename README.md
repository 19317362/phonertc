### How does PhoneRTC differ from OpenTok, Weemo, etc?

WebRTC is a peer-to-peer protocol, but it still needs some servers: a signaling server for initializing the call and a proxy server if the peer-to-peer connection fails.

Other solutions, such as OpenTok and Weemo, require you to use their own third-party servers. That means they are much easier to use, but that also means that they are less open, have a subscription model, and you are generally less in control.

PhoneRTC allows you to use your own servers, without relying on anyone.
